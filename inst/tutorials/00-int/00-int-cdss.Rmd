    - *Does Accommodation Work? Mainstream Party Strategies and the Success of Radical Right Parties* (with Werner Krause and Tarik Abou-Chadi)
    - *Getting the most out of comparative vote-switching data: A new framework for studying dynamic multiparty competition* (with Werner Krause and Tarik Abou-Chadi) [`rstan`]
- Far-right voting:
    - *Between strategy and protest: How policy demand, political dissatisfaction and strategic incentives matter for far-right voting* [`rstan`]
    - *Ökonomisches Risiko und die elektorale Anziehungskraft der AfD*
    - *Economic Risk, Anti-Immigration Preferences and Voting for the Radical Right* [`rstan`]
- The political economy of spatial inequalities:
    - *The Political Economy of Rental Housing* (with Tarik Abou-Chadi and Thomas Kurer)
    - *Preferences for rent control: Between political geography and political economy* [`brms`]
    - *The housing crisis on social media: Housing markets and the subnational diversification of policy supply* (with Tim Allinger and Andreas Küpfer) [`rstan`]
    - *Regional Labor Markets and the Politics of Resentment* (with Sergi Pardos-Prado)
- Methods:
    - [*Methods Bites: Blog of the MZES Social Science Data Lab*](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/) (with Cosima Meyer and Julian Bernauer)
    - *Estimating legislator-level issue salience and issue positions from political text* (with Andreas Küpfer) [`rstan`]
    - *Simulating party shares* (with Chris Hanretty) [`cmdstanr`]
    - *When (not) to trust the overlap in confidence intervals: A practical guide.*
    - *Applied Causal Inference (with R)* (with Paul C. Bauer)


## So, who are you?

Briefly tell me:

## Advanced Bayesian Statistical Modeling with R and Stan

### Primary Learning Objectives

1. Understand generalized linear models as a common theoretical framework for statistical models
1. Understand how to process estimates from generalized linear models into substantively meaningful quantities of interest *without* relying on pre-implemented software
1. Understand how to use distributional summaries as a flexible framework for reporting inferential uncertainty
1. *Applied* Bayesian statistics: Learn how to translate formal statistical models into code using Stan

### Secondary Learning Objectives

1. Bump up your programming skills
1. Bump up your understanding of probability theory
1. *Theoretical* Bayesian statistics: Learn about fundamentals concepts of Bayesian statistics

### Accreditation for CDSS members

You can earn ECTS points for participation in this class. For doing so, you must develop and apply a custom modeling solution in `rstan` and:

- Present your idea or preliminary implementation in a workshop for work-in-progress (Session 6), to be scheduled toward the end of the semester
- Submit, by January 31, 2023, one of the following:
  1. [4 ECTS] A technical report (max. 2,000 words), deriving, validating, and applying a custom Stan model
  2. [6 ECTS] A research note (max. 4,000 words + max. 1,000 words supplementary materials), embedding the derivation, validation, and application of a custom Stan model in a substantive or methodological contribution
  
Non-CDSS members can participate, too, of course.


## Structure of our sessions

We have 180 minutes per session. We will flexibly divide each session into the following sequence:

1. Lecture
2. Lab: Hands-on exercises (in small teams), solutions to exercises
3. Breaks (after +/- 90min, after lecture/before lab)

## Feedback

Feel free to share your feedback at any time, especially when you have suggestions that we can accommodate on the fly.
